## Bulletin
* At User Homepage
* ~~Admins can submit bulletin announcements~~
* ~~Live preview during submit~~
* Users can see bulletins in the past 2 weeks
* Bulletins are tagged by type (news, horizons, club events, admin)
* ~~Bulletin info stored on database.~~
* (Possible) on bulletin unread, pop a notification

## Alerts
* ~~Site wide~~
* ~~Admins can submit site wide alerts~~
* Admins can also remove site wide alerts
* Submitted Alerts are displayed
* Users can see alerts whether or not they are logged in
* ~~Once an alert is dismissed during a session, it doesn't pop up until the session is over~~

## Messages
* User Homepage
* Admins (and eventually users) can send messages to each other
* Senders will fill out a modal to send a message to a specific user (probably by email)
* Recipients will get a new notification and can read the Messages
* On message read, remove notification and mark as read.
* Messages can also be deleted.

### Attendance
* ~~Requires user account~~
* ~~Code changes every day, and is editdable by admins~~
* Users can see a display of what days they come in
* Users get badges for attending (badges for cumulative, ribbons for streaks, medals/trophies for special events)
* Possible leaderboard

### Achievements and Ribbons
* Achievements are earned through reaching a milestone (listed in Achievements.md)
* Ribbons are earned through streaks (listed in Ribbons.md)
